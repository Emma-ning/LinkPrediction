Most real-world social networks are heterogeneous and relations between different entities have different semantic meanings. Therefore techniques for link prediction in homogeneous networks can not be directly applied on heterogeneous ones. On the other hand, recent works that investigate link prediction in heterogeneous networks, do not consider the dynamics of social networks and ignore the timestamps associated to the relations. We propose a technique, called \texttt{LinkPredict}, that predict links between two nodes of given types and a target relation in a dynamic heterogeneous.
