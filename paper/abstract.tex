Most real-world social networks are heterogeneous and relations between different entities have different semantic meanings. Therefore techniques for link prediction in homogeneous networks can not be directly applied on heterogeneous ones. On the other hand, works that investigate link prediction in heterogeneous networks, do not consider the dynamics of social networks in sequential time intervals. We propose a technique, called \texttt{RelationPredict}, that predicts a target relationship between two nodes of given types in a dynamic heterogeneous.
