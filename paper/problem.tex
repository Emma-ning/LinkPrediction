\section{Problem Statement}

\begin{definition}[Dynamic heterogeneous social network]
A dynamic heterogeneous social network is defined as a directed graph $G$ = ($V$, $E$), where $V$ and $E$ are set of nodes and edges of different types, and edges have timestamps. $\Box$
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
The DBLP bibliographic network\footnote{\url{http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/}} is a dynamic heterogeneous social network, containing different types of nodes such as papers, authors, topics, and publication venues, with publication links associated with date. Twitter social network is another example with nodes of types posted tweets, users, topics, and hashtags and time window associated with these tweets. $\Box$
\end{example}

In the context of a heterogenous network, a \textit{link} can be either \textit{direct} or \textit{indirect}. An indirect link is a sequence of relationships (direct links) in the network. Thus, two nodes might not be directly connected, however they might be connected considering the semantic of a sequence of links of different types. In this work, therefore, the \textit{link prediction} problem refers to predicting whether two nodes will be connected in future via a sequence of relationships in the graph. Note that the length of sequence can be greater than or equal to one. For instance in a bibliographic network a direct link exist between an author and a paper he wrote, and an indirect link exist between him and his co-authors through the paper, which they wrote together.

\begin{definition}[\textbf{Link prediction problem}]\label{problemdef}
 Given A dynamic heterogeneous social network $G$ at time $t$ and a target relation $R$, we aim to predict a link of type $R$ between two given nodes at time $t+1$. $\Box$
 \end{definition}

In order to better understand different types of nodes and their relation in a network, the concept of \textit{network schema} \cite{sun2011pathsim} is used. The network schema is a meta structure graph that summarizes a heterogeneous social network and is formally defined as bellow.

\begin{definition}[Network schema]
The network schema $S_G=\mathcal{(A,R)}$ is a directed meta graph for a heterogeneous network $G=(V,E)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ is the set of node types in $V$ and $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of relation types in $E$.  $\Box$
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Figure \ref{schema} shows the network schema for DBLP bibliographic network, where $\mathcal{A}$=\{\textit{Authors}, \textit{Paper}, \textit{Venues}, \textit{Topics}\}. $\Box$
\end{example}

In this paper, we refer to different types of nodes for DBLP bibliographic network using abbreviations $P$ for papers, $A$ for authors, $T$ for topic, and $V$ for venues.

  \caption{Network schema for DBLP network.}\label{schema}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Meta path-based topology}

Similar to the notion of network schema that provides a meta structure for the network, a \textit{meta path} \cite{sun2011pathsim} provides a meta structure for paths between different nodes in the network. 

\begin{definition}[Meta path]
A meta path $\mathcal{P}$ is a path in the network schema graph $S_G = (\mathcal{A,R})$, denoted in the form of $\mathcal{P} = A_1 \xrightarrow{R_1} A1... \xrightarrow{R_n} A_{n+1}$, as a sequence of relations between node types, which defines a new composite relation between its starting type and ending type. $\Box$
\end{definition}



\begin{example}
In the DBLP network example, the co-author relation can be described with the meta path $A\xrightarrow{write}P\xrightarrow{write^{-1}}A$ or in short form \textit{A--P--A}. Paths in thick solid lines in Figure \ref{sampleNetwork} correspond to \textit{A--P--V--P--A} meta paths between Max and Ada. $\Box$

\end{example}

Each meta path indicates a different semantic for a path connecting two nodes, and defines a unique topology representing a special relation.

\begin{figure}[t]

      \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figs/exampleSocialNetwork.pdf}
  \caption{An example of \textit{A--P--V--P--A} meta paths between two authors Max and Ada.}\label{sampleNetwork}
\end{figure}



%By checking the existing topological features defined in homogeneous networks, we can find that both the neighbor set-based features and path-based features can be generalized in heterogeneous information networks, by considering paths following different meta paths. For example, if we treat each type of neighbors separately and extend the immediate neighbors to n-hop neighbors (i.e., the distance between one object and its neighbors are n), the common neighbor feature between two authors is then becoming the count of paths between the two authors following different meta paths. For path-based features, such as Katz, it can be extended as a combination of paths following different meta paths.
