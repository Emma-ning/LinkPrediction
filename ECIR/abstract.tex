Most real-world information networks, such as social networks, are heterogeneous and relations between different entities have different semantic meanings. Therefore techniques for link prediction in homogeneous networks cannot be directly applied on heterogeneous ones. On the other hand, works that investigate link prediction in heterogeneous networks, do not necessarily consider network dynamism in sequential time intervals. In this work we propose a technique that leverages a combination of latent and topological meta path-based features to predict a target relationship between two nodes of given types in a dynamic heterogeneous information network. Our results indicates that combining these features helps in building a more accurate predictive model compared to the state of the art techniques.\amin{TBA: experiments and findings.}
