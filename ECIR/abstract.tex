Most real-world information networks, such as social networks, are heterogeneous and relations between different entities have different semantic meanings. Therefore techniques for link prediction in homogeneous networks can not be directly applied on heterogeneous ones. On the other hand, works that investigate link prediction in heterogeneous networks, do not consider the dynamics of networks in sequential time intervals. In this work we propose a technique that leverages a combination of latent and meta path-based features to predict a target relationship between two nodes of given types in a dynamic heterogeneous information network. Our results indicates that combining these features helps in building a more accurate predictive model compared to current techniques that use either of these features.
