Most real-world information networks, such as social networks, are heterogeneous and as such, the relationships observed in these networks can be diverse and carry differing semantics.
 %relations between different entities have different semantic meanings. 
 Therefore techniques for link prediction in homogeneous networks cannot be directly applied on heterogeneous ones. On the other hand, works that investigate link prediction in heterogeneous networks do not necessarily consider network dynamism in sequential time intervals. In this work we propose a technique that leverages a combination of latent and topological meta path-based features to predict a target relationship between two nodes of given types in a dynamic heterogeneous information network. \ebrahim{Before saying "in our experiments" we need to enumerate the distinguishing aspects of our work and say why they are significant contributions.}Our experiment results on two real-world information network datasets show 10-40\% increase in AUCROC, and 25-30\% increase in prediction accuracy compared to the state of the art techniques.
