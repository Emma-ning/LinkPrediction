Most real-world information networks, such as social networks, are heterogeneous and as such, relationships in these networks can be of different types and hence carry differing semantics.
 %relations between different entities have different semantic meanings. 
 Therefore techniques for link prediction in homogeneous networks cannot be directly applied on heterogeneous ones. On the other hand, works that investigate link prediction in heterogeneous networks do not necessarily consider network dynamism in sequential time intervals. In this work we propose a technique that leverages a combination of latent and topological features to predict a target relationship between two nodes in a dynamic heterogeneous information network. Our technique, called MetaDynaMix, effectively combines meta path-based topology features and inferred latent features that incorporate temporal network changes in order to capture network (1) heterogeneity and (2) temporal evolution, when making link predictions. Our experiment results on two real-world datasets show 10-40\% increase in AUCROC, and 25-30\% increase in prediction accuracy compared to the state of the art techniques.
